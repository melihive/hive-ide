# Changelog

All notable changes to `hive-ide` will be documented in this file.

## Unreleased

### Fixed

- Opening a workspace now isolates sessions with missing directories or invalid
  package sources, records a session-scoped error, and continues building every
  healthy window instead of aborting the entire IDE.
- Relayout no longer crashes when every detached window starts at mobile size;
  the attached window's geometry is propagated across the frame, clearing stale
  zoom state, and package-source maintenance no longer changes session recency.
- Reopening an existing frame preserves its selected session instead of jumping
  to a record touched by maintenance.

## [1.0.0] - 2026-07-28

### Added

- Standalone, directory-scoped session storage keyed by immutable session IDs.
- A tmux frame with responsive sidebar, agent pane, plan pane, and configurable keys.
- Claude Code, Codex, Antigravity, and terminal drivers behind plugin entry points.
- Configurable sidebar state and icon-slot providers.
- Stable and editable development environments with per-session source switching.
- Agent status and compaction lifecycle hooks.
